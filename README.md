Final project for CSCI 4830


To run this, you should just be able to download the .app folder (for macs), or download the cu_campus_data folder and cu_campus.exe (for windows).
You can also download the entire repository and build it within Unity.


Used Unity as the engine and built most assets using Blender, but some were used from Turbosquid, which have Royalty Free Licenses.
